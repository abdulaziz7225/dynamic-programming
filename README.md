# Recursion, Backtracking and Dynamic Programming

This repository contains my solutions and notes from the **Ultimate Specialisation on Recursion, Backtracking and Dynamic Programming for Competitive Coding & Interviews** course.

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique that optimises problems by breaking them down into **overlapping subproblems** with **optimal substructure**. By storing the results of subproblems for future reference, it enables efficient solutions to computationally expensive tasks.
